            <p>I began ballroom in 2008. I fell in love with movement and the challenges and began competing in international latin. I wasn't the best at it, and had no natural body rhythm, but I worked hard and eventually was able to place in competitions. Eventually down the road I became a dance instructor and learned even more. There are so many different types of dance, just like there are so many programming languages. I learned while teaching that every style has core similarities and it's just dressed up a little differently with what is called style. The same can be said of programming, every language has root similarities with differences called syntax. Recognizing the similarities and differences helps to learn a new language faster while still maintaining skills in the old language.</p>
