            <p>Throughout life I have always been involved in sports. I had a glove on my hand by the time I could walk. I grew up playing mostly baseball on a team, but we would also play street hockey, football, soccer, basketball on the playgrounds and in the streets. In high school I started swimming. I always loved the water and being in it every day made me feel free. While I don't often play other sports as an adult, I still try to swim to this day. We each only have one body, and taking care of it helps to be productive in every other aspect of life. Exercising improves mental alertness and helps improve mood, helping to stay focused and get along with everyone else on the team.</p>
