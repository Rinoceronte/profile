            <p>I started my journey with music when I was 8. I began playing Cello. I would practice partially to annoy my siblings, but it was still practice. I became pretty good and decided to branch out to viola as a senior in high school. After a couple years I also started learning violin. Playing is a good way to help improve speed of thought. Every time I play I have to make sure I know how to get to the next note, quickly recognizing a note and changing my bow and my fingers to match.</p>
